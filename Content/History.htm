                <p>Founded by General Americus Smith in 1832, Americus was originally purchased for the purpose of being a plantation. General Smith's plantation grew large in cotton production and it provided much income for the town.</p>

                <p>Americus was a small courthouse town for the first two decades until the arrival of the railroad in 1854. The railroad was the only privately financed railroad in Georgia history.</p>
