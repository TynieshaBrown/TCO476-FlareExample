        <p>"Built in 1892, to attract winter visitors from the north, the Windsor was a 100-room, five story Victorian structure complete with towers, balconies, and a three story open atrium lobby." The Windsor is one of Americus' most prized possessions. It takes up the entire city block, and was the site of several balls and celebrations. The Windsor closed its doors in the early 1970s, but was recently restored and returned the historic structure to its original grandeur. Visitors can now stay in any of 53 period style rooms with all-modern amenities. No rooms in the Windsor are exactly the same.</p>
