        <p>The Rylander was originally built in 1921 and operated as a vaudeville theatre. Nestled in historic downtown Americus, and just blocks from the Windsor Hotel, the historic theatre is beautifully appointed and was painstakingly restored in the Art Deco style of design in 1999. With a seating capacity of 621, the Rylander Theatre offers live performances, organ concerts on the 1928 Moller Theatre Pipe Organ (one of only three in the entire state), movies and numerous special events throughout the year.</p>

        <p>Built in 1892, to attract winter visitors from the north, the Windsor was a 100-room, five story Victorian structure complete with towers, balconies, and a three story open atrium lobby. It occupies nearly an entire city block, and was the site of numerous balls and celebrations. As famous as the structure is, are the visitors who have graced its halls. The Windsor closed its doors in the early 1970s, but recently underwent a $5.8 million restoration which returned the historic structure to its original grandeur. Its grand opening celebration was attended by former President and First Lady Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter as well as many former guests who returned to the old hotel to relive its good old days. Visitors, now, can stay in any of 53 period style rooms with all-modern amenities. No rooms in the Windsor are exactly the same, so each room has its own warmth and style.</p>
