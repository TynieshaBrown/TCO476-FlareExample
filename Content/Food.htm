        <p>Floyds Pub</p>
        <p>"Floyd's Pub was opened in 1991 after a $5.8 million restoration project that restored The BEST WESTERN PLUS Windsor Hotel to her former beauty. The pub is named after former employee Floyd Lowery, who passed away long before the hotel reopened its doors in 1991. He was a bellman and elevator operator for The Windsor Hotel. As ironic as it sounds, Floyd Lowery never had a drink in his life!"</p>
